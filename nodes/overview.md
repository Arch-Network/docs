# Run a node

Arch node operators can run several options on the network.

Consensus:
- Validator node: The Validator node, or full node, stores state, performs validation, votes on blocks and provides signature shares to fulfill Bitcoin asset transfers.

RPC:
- Regular node: Regular nodes can serve as RPC services that relay messages to and from Arch validator nodes.

## Recommended hardware requirements

| Node type         | Memory      | CPU         | Disk       | Bandwidth |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Regular node        | 500 MB RAM  | Single core | 100 GB SSD | 56 Kbps   |
| Validator node | 16 GB RAM   | Quad-core   | 10 TB SSD  | 1 Gbps    |
