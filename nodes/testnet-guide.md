# Testnet

The Arch testnet is an environment focused on developers who
want to deploy programs with the latest changes from Arch Network's codebase.

Validators will be able to validate on the Arch Testnet as it is designed for fully-functioning dapps and for validators to get a feel for what incentivized participation looks like.

## About

This guide contains the relevant sections for how to connect to the Arch testnet depending on the type of node you are running. 

The Arch testnet is designed to help validators test out their infrastructure and node software, as well as builder teams deploy their programs and test app functionality on a live network.

## RPC endpoints

| Provider | URL |
|--------|--------|
| Arch | <https://rpc-01.test.arch.network/> |
| Local | <http://localhost:9001/> |

:::warning
While you can rely on the RPC service provided by the Arch team, there is also an option to run your own RPC node. 

In the spirit of true decentralization, this approach provides the added benefit of resilience; should Arch's public RPC experience an outage, your dapp (and users) would not be impacted as a result.
