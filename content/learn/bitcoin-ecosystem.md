Arch is redefining what's possible on Bitcoin. Here are the pillars we're most excited about:


## DeFi

Ethereum served as the testing grounds for DeFi. Now, we can port these protocols to Bitcoin.



* Overcollateralized loans backed by pristine Bitcoin
* Decentralized Runes Exchange (AMM, CLOB)
* Concentrated liquidity DEX with dynamic fees
* Bitcoin yield vaults


## GameFi

Money games have become the center of retail attention for the past few cycles. We’re excited to see these come to Bitcoin.



* A Bitcoin-backed house protocol, serving as a liquidity source for new iGaming platforms and a real-yield solution for Bitcoin.
* Token launchpads
* Prediction markets
* On-chain idle RPGs


## Art

Crypto serves artists like never before, providing a new frontier for distribution and permanence. Bitcoin is the best canvas for digital art to survive, and we advocate for new and existing artists to deploy here.



* Curated (generative) art auction house
* Tokenize and trade novel diffusion model outputs


## Metaprotocol Innovation

Arch enables metaprotocols to scale. Innovate on base layer UTXO organization, asset issuance, and programmability only on Arch. We currently support Runes and Ordinals standards.
