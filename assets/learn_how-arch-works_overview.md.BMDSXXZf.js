It offers more secure and decentralized utility than bridge-based options, including L2s that sacrifice liquidity for scalability, and meta-protocols, which are limited to state changes but can’t offer the programmatic decentralized asset transfers needed for Turing-complete programs.</p><p>Arch’s unique architecture enables trust-minimized programmable multisigs, multi-party computation, cross-program invocations, protocol interoperability, and other elements essential to building the pillars of Bitcoin DeFi, including lending markets, AMMs, and stablecoins.</p><p>Arch does not require any new op codes or soft forks.</p><p>Utilizing Arch&#39;s innovative design construct, dApps can now build with the needed flexibility and robustness without necessarily sacrificing self-custody, liquidity and interoperability.</p><p>Arch makes it possible for Bitcoin users to develop and interact with decentralized applications without taking on additional trust assumptions.</p><p>Discover the future of Bitcoin programs with Arch Network.</p>',10)]))}const m=e(a,[["render",n]]);export{h as __pageData,m as default};
