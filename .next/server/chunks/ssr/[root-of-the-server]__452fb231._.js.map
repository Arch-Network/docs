Failure recovery systems provide automatic detection of failed validators, seamless transition to backup leaders, recovery from temporary network failures, and rejoining procedures for validators that fall behind. Progress conditions guarantee block finalization when sufficient honest validators participate, ensuring no single validator can prevent progress while maintaining continued operation during validator churn. Deadlock prevention strategies eliminate waiting for specific validators, implement timeout mechanisms for unresponsive participants, and dynamically adjust protocol parameters to maintain network momentum under varying conditions.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h3, {\n      id: \"instant-finality\",\n      children: \"Instant Finality\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Once consensus is achieved, the network either has a valid signature or it doesn't, resulting in instant finality that doesn't allow the chain to fork.\"\n    })]\n  });\n}\nexport default function MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = props.components || ({});\n  return MDXLayout ? _jsx(MDXLayout, {\n    ...props,\n    children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, {\n      ...props\n    })\n  }) : _createMdxContent(props);\n}\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;;AACO,IAAI,cAAc;IACvB,SAAS;AACX;AACO,IAAI,sBAAsB;IAAC;QAChC,QAAQ;IACV;IAAG;QACD,QAAQ;IACV;IAAG;QACD,QAAQ;IACV;CAAE;AACK,IAAI,iBAAiB;IAC1B,YAAY;QAAC;YACX,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,WAAW;YACX,WAAW;QACb;KAAE;IACF,YAAY;QAAC;YACX,MAAM;YACN,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,MAAM;YACN,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,MAAM;YACN,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,MAAM;YACN,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,MAAM;YACN,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,MAAM;YACN,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,MAAM;YACN,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,MAAM;YACN,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,MAAM;YACN,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,MAAM;YACN,WAAW;QACb;QAAG;YACD,MAAM;YACN,WAAW;QACb;KAAE;AACJ;AACO,MAAM,MAAM;IAAC;QAClB,OAAO;QACP,KAAK;QACL,OAAO,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,mOAAS,EAAE;YACrB,UAAU;QACZ;IACF;IAAG;QACD,OAAO;QACP,KAAK;QACL,OAAO,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,mOAAS,EAAE;YACrB,UAAU;QACZ;IACF;IAAG;QACD,OAAO;QACP,KAAK;QACL,OAAO,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,mOAAS,EAAE;YACrB,UAAU;QACZ;IACF;IAAG;QACD,OAAO;QACP,KAAK;QACL,OAAO,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,mOAAS,EAAE;YACrB,UAAU;QACZ;IACF;IAAG;QACD,OAAO;QACP,KAAK;QACL,OAAO,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,mOAAS,EAAE;YACrB,UAAU;QACZ;IACF;IAAG;QACD,OAAO;QACP,KAAK;QACL,OAAO,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,mOAAS,EAAE;YACrB,UAAU;QACZ;IACF;IAAG;QACD,OAAO;QACP,KAAK;QACL,OAAO,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,mOAAS,EAAE;YACrB,UAAU;QACZ;IACF;IAAG;QACD,OAAO;QACP,KAAK;QACL,OAAO,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,mOAAS,EAAE;YACrB,UAAU;QACZ;IACF;IAAG;QACD,OAAO;QACP,KAAK;QACL,OAAO,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,mOAAS,EAAE;YACrB,UAAU;QACZ;IACF;IAAG;QACD,OAAO;QACP,KAAK;QACL,OAAO,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,mOAAS,EAAE;YACrB,UAAU;QACZ;IACF;IAAG;QACD,OAAO;QACP,KAAK;QACL,OAAO,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,mOAAS,EAAE;YACrB,UAAU;QACZ;IACF;CAAE;AACF,SAAS,kBAAkB,KAAK;IAC9B,MAAM,cAAc;QAClB,GAAG;QACH,IAAI;QACJ,IAAI;QACJ,IAAI;QACJ,GAAG;QACH,GAAG,MAAM,UAAU;IACrB;IACA,OAAO,IAAA,+NAAK,EAAC,mOAAS,EAAE;QACtB,UAAU;YAAC,IAAA,+NAAK,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;gBAC9B,UAAU;oBAAC;oBAAiM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;wBAC9N,MAAM;wBACN,UAAU;oBACZ;oBAAI;iBAAyQ;YAC/Q;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE,CAAC;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;gBAC5D,IAAI;gBACJ,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;gBAC7B,IAAI;gBACJ,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;gBAC5B,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;gBAC7B,IAAI;gBACJ,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;gBAC5B,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;gBAC7B,IAAI;gBACJ,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;gBAC5B,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;gBAC7B,IAAI;gBACJ,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;gBAC7B,IAAI;gBACJ,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;gBAC5B,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;gBAC7B,IAAI;gBACJ,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;gBAC5B,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;gBAC7B,IAAI;gBACJ,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;gBAC5B,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;gBAC5B,UAAU,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;oBAC5B,MAAM;oBACN,UAAU;gBACZ;YACF;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;gBAC7B,IAAI;gBACJ,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,+NAAK,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;gBAC7B,UAAU;oBAAC;oBAA0gB,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;wBACxiB,UAAU;oBACZ;oBAAI;oBAAgC,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;wBACvD,UAAU;oBACZ;oBAAI;iBAAuT;YAC7T;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;gBAC5B,UAAU,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;oBAC5B,MAAM;oBACN,UAAU;gBACZ;YACF;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;gBAC7B,IAAI;gBACJ,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;gBAC5B,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,EAAE,EAAE;gBAC7B,IAAI;gBACJ,UAAU;YACZ;YAAI;YAAM,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,YAAY,CAAC,EAAE;gBAC5B,UAAU;YACZ;SAAG;IACL;AACF;AACe,SAAS,WAAW,QAAQ,CAAC,CAAC;IAC3C,MAAM,EAAC,SAAS,SAAS,EAAC,GAAG,MAAM,UAAU,IAAK,CAAC;IACnD,OAAO,YAAY,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,WAAW;QACjC,GAAG,KAAK;QACR,UAAU,IAAA,8NAAI,EAAC,mBAAmB;YAChC,GAAG,KAAK;QACV;IACF,KAAK,kBAAkB;AACzB","debugId":null}},
