### About

This guide contains the relevant sections for how to connect to the Arch testnet RPC service, obtain testnet funds, and view transaction activity on the Arch block explorer.

The Arch testnet is designed to help builder teams deploy their programs and test app functionality on a live network. 


## RPC Endpoints

| Provider | URL |
|--------|--------|
| Arch | <https://rpc-01.test.arch.network/> |
| Local | <http://localhost:9001/> |

:::warning
While you can rely on the RPC service provided by the Arch team, there is also an option to run your own RPC node. 

In the spirit of true decentralization, this approach provides the added benefit of resilience; should Arch's public RPC experience an outage, your dapp (and users) would not be impacted as a result.

## Bitcoin Testnet4 Faucet

In order to participate in the Arch testnet, testnet4 Bitcoin is required to pay for transactions and be used in dapps as a medium of exchange with swaps, lending protocols, etc.

You can request testnet4 BTC from the [testnet4 mempool.space faucet].

A Twitter account is needed as a spam-protection measure.
