# Titan Indexer

Arch employs Titan, a custom-built Bitcoin indexer developed by Saturn, to power its high-performance transaction processing capabilities. Unlike existing indexers like Electrs, Titan is specifically engineered to support Arch's unique architecture requirements, particularly the pre-confirmation and rollback/reapply mechanisms described in previous sections.


### Key Capabilities

Titan distinguishes itself through several innovations:



* **Mempool-Level Indexing:** Titan is the only Bitcoin indexer capable of real-time mempool indexing. Optimized for immediate blockchain data retrieval, Titan delivers the responsiveness required for Arch's pre-confirmation mechanism and DeFi applications.
* **Runes Protocol Integration:** Built with native support for Bitcoin-based tokens, Titan provides comprehensive tracking and indexing of Runes tokens, enabling immediate access to token states, balances, and transfers.


### Developer Benefits

For developers building on Arch Network, Titan provides:



* **Reduced Latency:** Near-instantaneous data indexing ensures dApps remain responsive with minimal wait times for state updates.
* **Token-First Development:** Native Runes protocol support eliminates the need for additional middleware when building token-based applications.
* **Enhanced Reliability:** By providing visibility into mempool-level transactions, Titan helps developers implement safeguards against front-running and other potential issues.
