# Using multi-party programs to enable AMMs, LPs, and DEXs

Developers and dApp users have limited access to liquidity in the current Bitcoin DeFi system. They can do peer-to-peer transactions on Discreet-Log-Contracts (DLCs), which limits them to drawing assets from a single account, or an orderbook, which has similar liquidity challenges and only executes when buy/sell prices are matched perfectly. They can also try to use one of the few DEXs that current exist on the Bitcoin base layer, but these still require holders to give up custody through essentially centralized multisigs to use them.

Archâ€™s structure makes it possible to execute the multi-party contracts necessary for Liquidity Pools (LPs), which are foundational to building the Automated Market Makers (AMMs) that drive trust-minimized DEXs. These liquidity pools serve as an instant, permissionless source of liquidity from multiple sources, which borrowers can tap into without relying on DLCs or order books managed off-chain.

## Enabling DeFi on Bitcoin

### 1. Liquidity Protocols: 
Arch makes it possible to develop DeFi protocols that can tap into Bitcoin's massive liquidity pool. This could lead to the creation of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), liquidity pools, and automated market makers (AMMs) directly on Bitcoin, providing users with secure and efficient trading experiences.

### 2. Lending and Borrowing Platforms: 
By supporting smart contracts, Arch enables the creation of decentralized lending and borrowing platforms on Bitcoin. This allows users to lend their Bitcoin or other digital assets in a trustless manner, earning interest, or borrow against their holdings without the need for traditional financial intermediaries.

### 3. Yield Farming and Staking: 
Arch's infrastructure can support yield farming and staking mechanisms, offering users new ways to earn returns on their "Bitcoin-native" asset holdings. This could significantly enhance the utility of Bitcoin, transforming it from a "digital gold" into a productive asset within the DeFi ecosystem.

### 4. Synthetic Assets and Derivatives: 
With smart contract capabilities, Arch allows for the creation of synthetic assets and decentralized derivatives markets. This enables users to gain exposure to a wide range of assets and financial instruments, further diversifying the DeFi space on Bitcoin.

### 5. Cross-Chain Liquidity: 
Arch's focus on interoperability facilitates seamless interaction between Bitcoin and other blockchains, expanding the range of possibilities for DeFi applications. This can lead to innovative solutions that leverage the strengths of multiple chains for enhanced functionality and user experience.

By enabling these use cases, Arch Network not only enriches the Bitcoin ecosystem but also significantly contributes to the broader blockchain and DeFi landscape. The integration of smart contracts with Bitcoin's Layer 1 through Arch's innovative approach promises to unlock unprecedented opportunities for developers, investors, and users alike, fostering a more versatile, efficient, and inclusive financial system.
