# How Arch Unlocks the Core Pillars of DeFi

Despite significant innovations in recent years, programmability on Bitcoin has had significant limitations. In order to buy, sell, and exchange assets without giving up custody, Bitcoin-native marketplaces have previously been limited to basic trading of non-fungible assets like Ordinals. Indexers have few command options, which has made it impossible to form non-custodial DEXs for fungible tokens, such as BRC-20 and Runes. 

By enabling Turing-complete programs on Bitcoin, Arch lays the foundation for a fully-functioning DeFi system on the worldâ€™s most valuable blockchain.
