# Overview

**Arch is building the permissionless financial rails for a Bitcoin-denominated world.**

Leveraging a novel infrastructure stack, Arch solves the Bitcoin Builder’s Dilemma without a soft fork. 

**At its core, Arch combines:**

* **Decentralized Validator Network** that facilitates the seamless coordination of Bitcoin-native transactions and smart contracts via a stake-weighted dPoS consensus.
* **UTXO-aware Execution Environment** based on the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) virtual machine, embedded with custom syscalls that validate UTXOs and post transactions directly onto Bitcoin.
* **Cryptographic Multisig** built on the back of the [FROST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf) + [ROAST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf?ref=glossary.blockstream.com) signature schemes, allowing for decentralized programmable execution.

Arch unlocks a user and developer experience that previously wasn’t possible on Bitcoin:



* Access the full Arch ecosystem directly from your Bitcoin wallet (Xverse, Unisat, Magic Eden, Ledger, and more) through our seamless Taproot address integration — no bridging, no new wallets, just pure Bitcoin-native interaction.
* Trust-spectrum flexibility allows developers to either settle transactions directly on Bitcoin or leverage Arch's Bitcoin pre-confirmation system for sub-second block times that deliver an optimal user experience in their applications.
* Boost Runes and Ordinals liquidity with our Arch-native Titan indexer that scales UTXO capabilities.

Arch is the application layer Bitcoin has been missing, designed to preserve the monetary integrity of pristine BTC while enabling an open, fast, and expressive economy.
