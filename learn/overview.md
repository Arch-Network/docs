# Introduction

Welcome to the Arch Network: the only bridgeless execution platform that unlocks Bitcoin DeFi with Turing-complete smart contracts, known as programs, on the Bitcoin base layer.

Arch allows developers to tap into the full liquidity and security of the world’s most decentralized blockchain without forcing their users to bridge. 

Arch is not a L2 nor a metaprotocol. 

Its core innovation is a novel FROST + ROAST signature scheme that combines with a specialized VM and Validator Network to provide trust-minimized execution. It offers more secure and decentralized utility than bridge-based options, including L2s that sacrifice liquidity for scalability, and meta-protocols, which are limited to state changes but can’t offer the programmatic decentralized asset transfers needed for Turing-complete programs.

Arch’s unique architecture enables trust-minimized programmable multisigs, multi-party computation, cross-program invocations, protocol interoperability, and other elements essential to building the pillars of Bitcoin DeFi, including lending markets, AMMs, and stablecoins.

Arch does not require any new op codes or soft forks.

Utilizing Arch's innovative design construct, dApps can now build with the needed flexibility and robustness without necessarily sacrificing self-custody, liquidity and interoperability.

Arch makes it possible for Bitcoin users to develop and interact with decentralized applications without taking on additional trust assumptions.
