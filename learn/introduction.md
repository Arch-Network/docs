# Introduction

Welcome to the Arch Network: the only bridgeless execution platform that unlocks Bitcoin DeFi on the Bitcoin base layer.

Arch allows developers to tap into the full liquidity and security of the world’s most decentralized blockchain without forcing users to bridge. 

Arch is not an L2, nor is it a meta-protocol. 

Arch's core innovation is a novel FROST + ROAST signature scheme combined with a specialized VM and Validator Network to provide trust-minimized execution. It offers more secure and decentralized utility than bridge-based options, including L2s that sacrifice liquidity for scalability, and meta-protocols which are limited to state changes but can’t offer the programmatic decentralized asset transfers needed for Turing-complete programs.

Arch’s unique architecture enables trust-minimized programmable multisigs, multi-party computation, cross-program invocations, protocol interoperability, and other elements essential to building the pillars of Bitcoin DeFi, including lending markets, AMMs, and stablecoins.

Arch does not require any new op codes or soft forks to function.

Utilizing Arch's innovative design construct, dApp developers can now build with the needed flexibility and robustness without sacrificing self-custody, liquidity and interoperability.
