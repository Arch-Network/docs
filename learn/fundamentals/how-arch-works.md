# How Arch Works

Archâ€™s [FROST + ROAST signature scheme] allows the Arch Validator Network to collectively generate Bitcoin addresses and sign Bitcoin transactions, while retaining the ability to dynamically add and remove nodes from the signers/validators set (this allows the network to be both decentralized and robust/fault-tolerant). Each node runs an instance of the program execution environment, maintains a database of the associated state, and provides an RPC interface for users to access the network.

_Diagram coming soon._
