# Bridgeless Execution

Unlike L2s and meta-protocols where users must bridge or wrap their assets and then send the assets to a smart contract, Arch allows users to send their assets directly through the smart contract invocation **without bridging or wrapping first.**

All asset transfers can occur using native bitcoin transactions involving UTXOs, although account-based systems such as Layer 2s can also be built using Arch (to optimize transaction speeds as high-performance chains do, for example).
